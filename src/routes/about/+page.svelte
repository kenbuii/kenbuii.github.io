        Before, I worked at Lux Capital, a deeptech VC firm, where I helped develop the first-ever wargame 
        in the VC world, partnering with Michael Bloomberg, the Departments of Defense and State, and tech 
        industry leaders. I also wrote on AI/ML, national security, geopolitics, energy and industrial policy, 
        and the defense industrial base.

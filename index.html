  I am interested in the intersections of national security, science and technology, industrial, and energy security policy. <br><br>

  Most recently, I worked at 
  <a href="https://www.luxcapital.com/">Lux Capital</a>,
   a venture capital firm with $5 billion AUM, analyzing 
  <a href="https://www.luxcapital.com/securities/ip-ip-betray">AI/ML, national security, geopolitics,</a>
  <a href= "https://www.luxcapital.com/securities/powering-power">energy and industrial policy,</a> 
  market trends, and the 
  <a href= "https://www.luxcapital.com/securities/striking-employment">defense industrial base. </a>
  
  <br><br>

  I'm a proud community college graduate and alumni of 
  <a href="https://www.ohlone.edu/">Ohlone College</a>, where I was the first and only person in 8 years to win the 
  <a href= "https://www.ohlone.edu/facultysenate/studentawards/20212022"> departmental award in Philosophy.</a>
          
  <br><br>
  In another life, I was an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AF ROTC) Officer Cadet, tracking the 
  <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/intelligence/intelligence-officer">14N AFSC</a>.

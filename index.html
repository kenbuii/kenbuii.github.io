  I am interested in the intersections of national security, science and technology, industrial, and energy security policy. <br><br>

  Most recently, I worked for Lux Capital, a venture capital firm with $5 billion AUM, analyzing AI/ML, national security, market trends, geopolitics, energy and industrial policy, and the defense industrial base. <br><br>

  I'm a proud community college graduate and alumni of Ohlone College. In another life, I was an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Officer Cadet, tracking the 14N AFSC. <br><br>

  I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) at Stanford University.
